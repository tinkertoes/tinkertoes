- 👋 Hi, I’m @tinkertoes. I'm on GitHub at the loving behest of the programming team at Project Pixel, an indie 2D game development team.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... gamification, and making the processes and opportunities to build things with code more accessible. I have a penchant for solarpunk and grimdark themes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... coding-wise, Unity and C# for developing 2D games (specifically, a tower defense-type ), Python for computational architectural design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 2D/3D indie games, interactive storytelling. I'm also looking to collaborate with non-profits and charities on serious games/games with a purpose (GWAPs). If you (by any slim chance) have an interest in the vintage French cartoon Barbapapa, hit me up! 
- 📫 How to reach me ... yingxuanchian@gmail.com.
